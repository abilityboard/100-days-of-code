### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much, mostly reading and figuring things out. Did a few of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting steps for fun.

**Thoughts:**: Some days there's just not much visible progress.  

**Link to work:** Nope, nothing today. Just plotting and trying to learn.

### Days 4 - 6

**Progress**: A few more tutorials/courses from Javascript30 and FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Need to learn more to better myself, but just learned I have to prioritize certain things I'd rather not.

### Day 7: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Skipped over tutorials and courses.  Decided to play around and try to make a random game. Mostly successful, identified things I'd like to learn more about.

**Thoughts:**: Sometimes you just need to stop and have fun.
